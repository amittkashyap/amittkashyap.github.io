I have gravitated more towards listening these days while being stuck in the traffic or doing daily chores that mostly requires the use of system 1 in my brain as explained in “Thinking, Fast & Slow” by Daniel Kahneman. System 1 is the brain's fast, automatic, intuitive approach.

Some books in my opinion are more suited to be read than just listen. However, let’s save this topic for another day.

This week I'm listening/reading these great books slowly and steadily especially if you think about the arguments made by Adam Grant. 
```
- Thing Again by Adam Grant. (on Audible)
- Naked Mind by Annie Grace. (on Kindle)
```

One another interesting book that I'm keen on finishing soon is *The Manager's Path by Camille Fournier*. I have observed and read quite a few chanllenges about managing people post covid era, in a hybrid setup. So yes this is on my immediate list.
